    "**Multithreading:**\n",
    "Multithreading is a programming technique that allows multiple threads of execution to run concurrently within a single process. In Python, multithreading is achieved through the use of the threading module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why multithreading is used in python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of using multithreading in Python (or any programming language) is to improve the performance of a program by allowing it to perform multiple tasks concurrently. By using multiple threads, a program can take advantage of the available CPU cores, which can lead to significant performance improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, multithreading can be used in a wide variety of applications, including web scraping, data analysis, and network programming. For example, a web scraper may use multiple threads to download and process data from multiple websites simultaneously. A data analysis tool may use multiple threads to perform computationally intensive tasks such as machine learning or natural language processing. A network programming application may use multiple threads to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that while multithreading can improve performance in certain situations, it's not always the best solution. In some cases, using multiprocessing or asynchronous programming may be a better choice. Additionally, multithreading can introduce some complexity and potential issues such as race conditions and deadlocks, so it's important to use it judiciously and with care.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name the module used to handle threads in pyhton:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The module used to handle threads in Python is called threading. It provides a simple way to create and manage threads in a Python program. The threading module provides the Thread class, which is used to create a new thread. It also provides various methods and functions to manage and control threads, such as start(), join(), setDaemon(), and Lock()."

    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads or processes are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release a resource that they need to proceed.

    "A race condition occurs when the outcome of a program depends on the order in which two or more threads or processes execute. This can happen when multiple threads or processes try to access the same shared resource concurrently, and the outcome depends on the timing of these accesses. For example, if two threads try to write to the same memory location at the same time, the resulting value may be unpredictable. Race conditions can cause programs to produce incorrect results, and they can be difficult to reproduce and debug.\n",
